TO CHECK:
	- PC menu
	- Battle screens

TO CONSIDER:
	- Two approaches to text:
		- Emulate older GBS
			- Letters advance max. 2 frames at a time
			- Safe for use with the current AutoBGMapTransfer of
			  half the screen per frame
		- Emulate newer GBS
			- Letters advance max. 1 frames at a time
			- Requires a hack to make AutoBGMapTransfer update only
			  the top half of the screen (because that's where the
			  WINDOW is), seems risky
			- Can press A to instantly advance a line (sensitive)
